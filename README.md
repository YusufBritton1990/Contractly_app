# Contractly_app

Steps:

Currently, I am trying to use a PUT request to update a campaign with content. 
For now, I am able to add HTML into this request and I see that it comes back in a response, but the MC campaign isn't updated.


Links

My project url, which is including the campaign app's urls
C:\Users\Youth\Desktop\Django\MailChimp Campaign test\MEmail\MEmail\urls.py

My campaign urls, which triggers my GET, PUSH, and PUT calls. GET is retrieving the campaign, PUSH is creating it, and PUT is supposed to update it with content
C:\Users\Youth\Desktop\Django\MailChimp Campaign test\MEmail\campaign\urls.py

This has my function definitions that invoke with the url calls.
C:\Users\Youth\Desktop\Django\MailChimp Campaign test\MEmail\campaign\views.py
